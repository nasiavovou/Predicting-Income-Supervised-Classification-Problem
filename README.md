# Predicting-Income-Supervised-Classification-Problem
In this project, I will use census data from UCI's Machine Learning Repository to predict whether or not a person makes more than $50,000. I will first create a Random Forest Classifier and compare its accuracy with a Decision Tree Classifier using the same data.
